# randomscripts

This repo contains a bunch of scripts that I create becaise I'm bored or need to do something quick and tedious.

# Quick list of what each script does

10-master - is an motd i made for my vm, looks and runs like absolute crap

GiveMinecraftName.sh - gives you a generic minecraft server name

gibrom.sh - Rips the images from the-rom.eu

mcFilesRipper.sh - gets all the files from mojangs servers, unlike mcjavaripper which only gets the client jars

trackTemp.sh - displays the current temp of your pc every X seconds
